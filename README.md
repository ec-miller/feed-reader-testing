# Feed Reader Testing
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

This app is Project 4 in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This project is an exercise in implementing front-end testing with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

To view the testing functionality download this repo and load index.html in a browser, scroll to the bottom of the feeds to see the Jasmine reporter. Check out jasmine/spec/feedreader.js to see the tests we are running. If you want to see what a failure looks like, you can monkey around with js/app.js and reload index.html until you see red in the Jasmine reporter.
